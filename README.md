For when you donâ€™t want your promises to give up on the first attempt (most commonly because of network failure).

Pass in a promise-returning function (X), get a wrapped function back that calls X until it fulfills/resolves, or until 5 attempts have been made. Exponential back-off by default, highly configurable, no dependencies.

## Syntax

`butYouPromised(yourFunction[, options])`

### Parameters

`yourFunction` _required function_

A function that returns [a promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). A common usecase would be a function that makes a network request when called.

`options` _optional object_

An object that can be passed-in to override default settings.

- `giveUpAfterAttempt` _optional integer, the default is 5_

	An integer that sets the maximum number of times `yourFunction` will be called before rejecting. The number set here will only ever be reached if your functionâ€™s promise consistently rejects.

- `backOffSeedDelayInMs` _optional integer, the default is 1000_

	An integer that sets the back off delayed seed in milliseconds. This can be used to set the delay when omitting the default `createBackOffFunction`

	### Example with default back-off function

	```js
	const wrappedFunction = butYouPromised(yourFunction, {
		backOffSeedDelayInMs: 2000,
		giveUpAfterAttempt: 10
	});
	```

- `createBackOffFunction` _optional function, the default creates an exponential delay function_

	A function used internally to create a back-off strategy between attempts, when first wrapping `yourFunction`. When called, `createBackOffFunction` should return a new function (letâ€™s call it Y here for clarity). Y should return an integer and will be called after each failed attempt, in order to determine the minimum number of milliseconds to wait before another attempt (unless `giveUpAfterAttempt` has been reached). Y will be called internally with one parameter, which is a count of how many attempts have been made so far. This gives you flexibility to define how your subsequent attempts are made.

	#### Example custom back-off function

	```js
	createBackOffFunction: ({ seedDelayInMs }) => {
		return attemptsSoFar => attemptsSoFar * seedDelayInMs;
	}
	```

	#### If you donâ€™t want a back-off

	```js
	createBackOffFunction: () => () => 0
	```

- `onFulfilled` _optional function, the default is a no-op function (but passes the result through)_

	A function that will be called internally if `yourFunction`â€™s promise is fulfilled. This is useful if you want to override what is deemed a successful scenario, such as a network request that returns a 500 response.

	#### Example custom onFulfilled function

	```js
	onFulfilled: (result = {}) => {
		if (result.status > 500) {
			throw new Error(`Received a server error ${result.status}`);
		}

		return result;
	}
	```

- `onRejected` _optional function, the default is a no-op function (well, kindaâ€”it rethrows the received error)_

	A function that will be called internally every time `yourFunction`â€™s promise is rejected (if at all). This is useful if you want to override what is deemed a failure scenario, or if you want to log attempts.

	*Note that you should rethrow the error passed into this function if you want to trigger another attempt (unless the `giveUpAfterAttempt` number has been reached).*

	#### Example custom onRejected function for logging

	```js
	onRejected: (err) => {
		console.error(`Failed to do the thing. Got this error message: ${err.message}`);
		throw err; // replay error to trigger subsequent attempts
	}
	```

	#### Example custom onRejected function to avoid multiple attempts for certain scenarios

	```js
	onRejected: (err) => {
		if (err.status >= 500) { // If the error is not expected to change with multiple attempts (in this case if an HTTP network response code is, say, 404 (not found), subsequent attempts are not helpful)
			throw err; // replay error to trigger subsequent attempts
		}
	}
	```


### Return value

Always returns a `function` that will return a promise when called.

## Installation

- via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): `npm install but-you-promised`
- via [yarn](): `yarn add but-you-promised`

## Usage

Wrap your promise-returning function like this:

```js
const { yourFunction } = require('./your-module');
const wrappedFunction = require('but-you-promised')(yourFunction);
```

### With promises

Before:

```js
yourFunction('yourParameter1', 'yourParameter2', 'yourParameter3')
	.then(result => console.log('Result:', result))
	.catch(() => {
		console.log('Failed after only 1 attempt');
	});
```

After:

```js
wrappedFunction('yourParameter1', 'yourParameter2', 'yourParameter3')
	.then(result => console.log('Result:', result))
	.catch(() => {
		console.log('Failed after a maximum of 5 attempts');
	});
```

### With async/await

Before:

```js
(async () => {
	try {
		const result = await yourFunction('yourParameter1', 'yourParameter2', 'yourParameter3');
		console.log('Result:', result);
	} catch (err) {
		console.log('Failed after only 1 attempt');
	}
}());
```

After:

```js
(async () => {
	try {
		const result = await wrappedFunction('yourParameter1', 'yourParameter2', 'yourParameter3');
		console.log('Result:', result);
	} catch (err) {
		console.log('Failed after a maximum of 5 attempts');
	}
}());
```

## Things to bear in mind

- Itâ€™s worth making sure that `yourFunction` doesnâ€™t already make multiple attempts if a promise rejects (for example if youâ€™re wrapping a third-party function), else you may make more network calls than youâ€™re intending!
- If youâ€™re using this software as part of an ongoing web request, consider using a custom back-off function (which delays exponentially by default), or reducing the default number of attempts (5), otherwise the original request may time out.

## Migration guide

### Upgrading from v1.x.x to v2.x.x

- Calling `butYouPromised` now returns a function wrapper for `yourFunction`
- No more passing your parameters in an awkward options.data objectâ€”use the returning function wrapper as you normally would use `yourFunction`
- optional overrides are passed in via an options object when wrapping `yourFunction`, where:
	-  `backoffStrategy` becomes `createBackOffFunction`
	- `triesRemaining` becomes `giveUpAfterAttempt`

```js
// v1 / Before
const yourParameterObj = { example: 123 };

butYouPromised(yourFunction, {
	backoffStrategy: ({ seedDelayInMs }) => {
		return attemptsSoFar => (attemptsSoFar * attemptsSoFar) * seedDelayInMs;
	},
	data: yourParameterObj,
	triesRemaining: 10
})
	.then(yourThenHandler)
	.catch(yourCatchHandler);
```
```js
// v2 / After
const yourParameterObj = { example: 123 };

const wrappedFunction = butYouPromised(yourFunction, {
	// If this is the back-off strategy youâ€™re using, you can omit this now as itâ€™s the default :-)
	createBackOffFunction: ({ seedDelayInMs }) => {
		return attemptsSoFar => (attemptsSoFar * attemptsSoFar) * seedDelayInMs;
	},
	giveUpAfterAttempt: 10
});

wrappedFunction(yourParameterObj)
	.then(yourThenHandler)
	.catch(yourCatchHandler);
```
